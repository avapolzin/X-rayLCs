# X-ray light curves (0.3 - 10 keV)
Data from <link to arXiv/ADS once paper is submitted>. The tables in the appendix list the original provenance of these data.

Each folder has its own README file that lists details of the included files and will have a copy of the table that offers citations (_including references therein_) for these data.

If you are going to use data found here, please cite both the original source(s) of the data listed in the relevant table and Polzin et al. (2022).


{Note to co-authors: There will also be a set of helper scripts for people to plot data for the individual classes of transients -- I have not had a chance to put that together yet, but I would be inclined to upload those to pypi as well so that people can use colab to plot our data.}
