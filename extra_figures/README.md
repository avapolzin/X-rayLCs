*X-ray_transient+variable_DLPS_labels.pdf* is the same as Figure 1 from Polzin et al. submitted, but each class of transient is labeled on the plot itself.

*X-ray_Oddball_DLPS_labels.pdf* is the same as Figure 5, but each class of transient is labeled on the plot itself.

*etendue_v2.pdf* is the same as Figure 7, but the relative number of detections for a transient of fixed luminosity and rate is shown normalized to the median FOV (1 deg<sup>2</sup>) and sensitivity (10<sup>-13</sup> erg s<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>) of instruments examined in the paper.

*etendue_v2_contour.pdf* is the same as Figure 7, but the relative number of detections for a transient of fixed luminosity and rate is shown normalized to the median FOV (1 deg<sup>2</sup>) and sensitivity (10<sup>-13</sup> erg s<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>) of instruments examined in the paper. Here this is shown with order-of-magnitude contours for ease in reading. Bands get darker with increasing N<sub>obs</sub>.
