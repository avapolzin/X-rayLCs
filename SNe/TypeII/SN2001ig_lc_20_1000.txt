Ref= IAUC 7913 Schlegel & Ryder 2002
Spec Model= Assumed 3keV thermal bremstrahlung absorbed by NH=1.3d20 cm-2
Comments: the error on the flux only account for the systematic unc deriving from the
assume 3keV temperature. Assuming kT=1keV or kT=5 keV a 20% variation of the estimated
flux is obtained. In the IAUC circular another Chandra obs is annouced to follow the lc decay.
I did not find the data published.
