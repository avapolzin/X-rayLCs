SpecModel= Optically thin thermal plasma (Raymond-Smith model unser XSPEC). The 
statistics is too low to allow a proper spectral fitting and the uncertanty mainly arises
from the NH.
Comments: the uncertainty quoted takes into account different assumptions on the NH
(see their Table 2) and spans the entire range of values obtained accounting for the
statistical uncertany on every flux. The contamitating source which appears on 
Chandra images has been subtracted. There are XMM obs taken on 7 January 2003
where the SN is no longer detected. No upper limit on the flux is quoted.
