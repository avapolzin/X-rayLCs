SpecModel= double MEKAL model; 
Comments: Chandra and ASCA data have been extrapolated to the 0.2-10 keV; XMM value simmetrized with respect tot he uncertainties;
Values digitized from Fig. 4 Zampieri 2005. ASCA observations are probably contaminared by a nearby X-ray source. For the value reported below an attempt has been made by Zampieri to subtract this contribution (See Zampieri Sec 5 for details).
