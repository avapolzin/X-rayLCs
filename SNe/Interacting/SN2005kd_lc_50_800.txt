SpecModel=  very hard power-law with index ~0.14 and Galactic NH. 
Comments: this events reaches a lum of 1d41: one of the highest. XMM observations were announced in Atel#1023
to be perfomed on March 2007 under id=410581101. I've found no trace of those obs. in the literature. The error provided
accounts for the diff. flux obtained with different models. The flux listed is the mid value of the max and min values
obtained assuming different spec models.
